   * Insert a new substring to be reassembled into a ByteStream.

   *   `data`: the substring itself
   *   `is_last_substring`: this substring represents the end of the stream
   *   `output`: a mutable reference to the Writer
   *
   * The Reassembler's job is to reassemble the indexed substrings (possibly out-of-order
   * and possibly overlapping) back into the original ByteStream. As soon as the Reassembler
   * learns the next byte in the stream, it should write it to the output.
   *
   * If the Reassembler learns about bytes that fit within the stream's available capacity
   * but can't yet be written (because earlier bytes remain unknown), it should store them
   * internally until the gaps are filled in.
   *
   * The Reassembler should discard any bytes that lie beyond the stream's available capacity
   * (i.e., bytes that couldn't be written even if earlier gaps get filled in).
   *
   * The Reassembler should close the stream after writing the last byte.
